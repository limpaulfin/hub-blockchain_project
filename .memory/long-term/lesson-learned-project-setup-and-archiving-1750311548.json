  "lesson": {
    "context": "The user completed one project (a university course) and wanted to start a new, separate project. This required archiving the old notes and correctly setting up the directory structure and rules for the new project.",
    "what_happened": "We successfully moved the completed project folder to 'Z-archive-storage'. Then, through clarification, we created a new dedicated folder for the new project under '/projects', created a new .mdc rule to enforce the storage location, and initialized the project with an overview note.",
    "key_takeaway": "When starting a new project, it is crucial to first define its scope and place in the existing folder structure. Creating a dedicated rule file (.mdc) helps automate and enforce consistency for future note-taking. Archiving old projects keeps the workspace clean."
  },
  "actionable_checklist": [
    "Confirm with the user that a project is complete.",
    "Identify the correct archive location (e.g., 'Z-archive-storage') using 'tree' or 'find'.",
    "Move the completed project folder into the archive directory using 'mv'.",
    "Discuss with the user to clarify the nature and correct placement of the new project.",
    "Create a new, clearly-named directory for the new project.",
    "Create a new .mdc rule file in '.cursor/rules/' that specifies the storage path and activation keywords for the new project.",
    "Create an initial overview/index note inside the new project folder to define its purpose and structure."
